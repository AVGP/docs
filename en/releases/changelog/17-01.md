# Release notes for January

## 04.01.17

### Changes:

* The model detail page allows viewer-only-mode now
* Model loading in the dashboard has been improved

### Fixes:

* If an object was selected while the sidebar menu was closed, deselecting the object could cause the menu to reappear. This release corrects this behaviour.
* The folder view was missing the addresses for each model
* Editing the address of a model in the tile overlay menu did not work correctly
