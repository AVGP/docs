# Release for the 07.12.16

## Improvements

* The 3D editor now also allows to import images with the extension `.jpeg` in addition to the already supported extensions.
* The DXF export was previously producing invalid files under certain circumstances. The issue is now resolved.
* Orders are now limited to accepting five models in one batch to avoid browsers from breaking the uploads.
* Multiple photos can now be added via drag and drop when ordering a model.
* We improved the error reporting when a credit card is declined while upgrading a subscription.
* General improvement of the error messages in the application.
