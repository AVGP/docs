# Order an Archilogic 3d model
<br>

## How it works in short

The way to your own 3d model is really easy. All you need is a 3d floor plan of the apartment or office you want to have a 3d model of. You upload your floor plan and we use it to create a fully modelled, rendered and furnished 3d model within 24 hours.

## Order Form

The first and most important thing you have to do is to upload a floor plan. You can either drag and drop the image file or pdf of the floor plan onto the box or simply click into the box to open a context menu to select the image or pdf file manually.

The second thing you have to decide is whether the model you want to order is an apartment or an office. If it's an apartment, choose **Residential** and if it's an office **Commercial**.

The third step is to determine how big the model is. You can usually find this information on the floor plan. Here you can also switch between **metric** and the **imperial** unit system. The price is going to change depending on the size and type of the model.

You can then add additional information to the model. It is mandatory to give the model a name so that we and you are able to recognize it. If you want to use the map functionality of Archilogic you can also add the address of the model. Furthermore you can tell us on which floor the model lies and what the room height is. If you don't give us a value for the room height we will use the standard value of 2.4 meters.

Finally you can attach additional image files to your order. These image files can be photographs or renderings and will help us to create more accurate models. Again you can add them by either dragging and dropping them on to the dotted box or by clicking into the box to open the file explorer and search for the images manually.
