#Edit Folders
If you enter a folder 3 new buttons will be visible in the top right corner of the screen, just beneath the Add new model button.

![Folder Menu]({{site.path}}/assets/images/Platform-Folder-Menu.jpg){: .img-responsive}

* The first button allows you to copy the link of a folder and share it with friends or coworkers. Please keep in mind, that only models with the **public** privacy option will be shown to a viewer that is not logged in or doesn't belong to your organization. Models with the **hidden** or **private** option will not be visible for viewers that are not logged in or not in the same organization.

* The second button lets you rename the folder.

* The third button lets you delete the folder. Please be careful with the delete option as it is permanent and also deletes all the models within this folder.
