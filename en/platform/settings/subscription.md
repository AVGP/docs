# Subscription

You can find the subscription menu here: [http://spaces.archilogic.com/subscriptions](http://spaces.archilogic.com/subscriptions)

In your subscription menu you can select which subscription you want to use.
By clicking on the **Start Free Trial** button you can start a free 30 day trial of the Archilogic Professional subscription. After these 30 days your Archilogic account will automatically revert back to the free Archilogic Community subscription. If you decide to continue using the Archilogic Professional subscription you will have to upgrade manually.

If you click on the "edit" link next to the number of users, you get to the [user menu](users.html) where you can invite additional user to your organization.
