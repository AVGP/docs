# Users

You can find the users menu here: [http://spaces.archilogic.com/users](http://spaces.archilogic.com/users)

In the users menu you can add additional users to your organization. The number of users you can add to your organization depends on the type of subscription you have.
Each user of the organization can edit the models or folders of that organization.
Please keep in mind that each user you add to your organization has the same subscription as the main account and therefore affect the license count.

* Click on **Invite more users** to add additional users to your organization. Once you clicked on the link you can enter the email address of the person you want to invite. You can only invite people to your organization whos email address is not already associated with an already existing Archilogic account.

* Click on the **change password** button to change the password of your Archilogic account.

* Click on the **edit** button to edit the name and email address of your Archilogic account. <br>
**If you change the name of your account, keep in mind to use your new user name the next time you log into Archilogic**
