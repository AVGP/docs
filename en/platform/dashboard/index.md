# Dashboard

The dashboard is your main working space within the Archilogic platform. Here you can find all 3d models that you either bought from Archilogic or built yourself. You have the options to search for certain models by name, [edit the model information](edit-model.html) or use different sorting and [display modes](display-options.html).

By clicking on a thumbnail you open the model in the Archilogic [3d editor]({{site.path}}/en/3d-editor/introduction/index.html). In the 3d editor you can for example change the furnishing or customize the camera bookmarks.
To get back from the 3d editor to the dashboard simply click on the **< All models** link in the header.
