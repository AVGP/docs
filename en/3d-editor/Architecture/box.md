# Boxes

The box can be used as a temporary placeholder object in a scene to check if a certain furniture piece that may not be in our library fits into a space or not. It can also be used to model primitive objects.
The box consists of two different parts, the top and the sides, both of which can be materialized separately.

The dimensions of the box can be changed by either using the handles or by entering the exact values into the respective fields of the context menu. All values are in meters.

# Polyboxes

The polybox is handles the similar to the polyfloor. It can also be used as either a temporary placeholder object or used to model primitive objects.
Like the polyfloor additional handles can be added by clicking on the desired position on the box. Unnecessary handles can be removed by clicking on them again.
The height of the box can be adjusted by entering a value into the text field in the context menu.
The box consists of two different parts, the top and the sides, both of which can be materialized separately.
