# Railing

The railing object handles mostly the same as the closet and the railing object, but has some object specific options. The object has two handles. The first handle with the four triangles is used to move the object around while the second handle with the two bent arrows is to rotate or enlarge it.

If the railing is selected you can find some more options to customize the railing object in the context menu on the right.

* The **Vertical Position** determines how far the railing is above the ground.

* The **Height** determines how high the railing is going to be.

* The **Width** value determines the width of the railing. It can be increased to a maximum of 30 centimeters.

* If you move your mouse cursor over the **Color** field a box pops up that lets you select a color for the railing.

* The **Segmentation** drop down menu lets you decide whether you want the object to add poles automatically depending on the length or if you want to set a fix number of poles.

* The **Pole Length** determines how thick the poles and the frame of the railing will be

* The **Segments** value only has an influence on the object if *Number of Segments* is selected in the Segmentation drop down menu. It determines the number of segments of the curtain.

* The **Segment Distance** value only has an influence on the object if *Distance (Rounded)* is selected in the Segmentation drop down menu. It determines the rounded distance between the poles and tries to roughly keep the distance by adding or removing railing poles.
