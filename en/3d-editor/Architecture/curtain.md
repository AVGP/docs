# Curtain

The curtain object handles mostly the same as the closet and the railing object, but has some object specific options. The object has two handles. The first handle with the four triangles is used to move the object around while the second handle with the two bent arrows is to rotate or enlarge it.

If the curtain is selected you can find some more options to customize the curtain object in the context menu on the right.

* The **Vertical Position** determines how far the curtain is above the ground.

* The **Height** determines how high the curtain is going to be.

* The **Length** value determines the overall length of the curtain. The length of the object can be changed by either entering a value into the textbox or be simply dragging the handle with the two bent arrows.

* The **Width** value determines the width of the curtain. It can be increased to a maximum of 30 centimeters.

* With the **Folds** value the number of folds in the curtain can be increased or decreased.

* If you move your mouse cursor over the **Color** field a box pops up that lets you select a color for the curtain.
