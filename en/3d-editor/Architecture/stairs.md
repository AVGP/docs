The stairs object has some similarities to the closet object but has some additional features.
The stairs consists of three different parts, the stair, the tread and the railings, all of them can be materialized separately.

The dimensions of the stairs can be changed by either using the handles or by entering the exact values into the respective fields of the context menu. All values are in meters.

* The **Stair Type** determines which type of stair is displayed in the scene. Besides the standard **Straight** stair type there are also several other types like: **Straight with landing**, **L-Shaped**, **Half Landing**, **2Quarter Landing**, **Winder**, **Double Winder**, **Spiral**.

* The **Vertical Position** determines at which height the starting point of the stair object is. The standard value is at 0 meters.

* The **Height** determines the height of the ending point of the stairs. The standard value is: 2.4 meters.

* With **Step Width** the user can increase or decrease the with of the steps. The standard value is: 1.2

* There are two **Railing types**. One with vertical bars and one with filling.

* With the **Railing** dropdown menu the user can determine whether the railings are on the left, the right, on both sides or if there are no railings at all.

* The **Tread thickness** value determines how high the vertical thickness of the treads is. The standard value is 0.02 meters.

* The **Stair thickness** value determines how high the vertical thickness of the stair is. The standard value is 0.17 meters.

* If the **Lock this item** checkbox is active the stair object becomes locked and can't be selected anymore. To select locked objects you first have to open the architectural menu and then activate the **Edit locked objects** checkbox there.
