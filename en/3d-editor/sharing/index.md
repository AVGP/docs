# Sharing

Sharing your Archilogic model with a friend is very easy.  
Click on the share button to open the share context menu.
![Share Menu Button]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/Basic-Share-Button.jpg){: .img-responsive}

The share menu allows you to share your content in several different ways, as a Google short link, as a QR-code or even as an iframe to embed it on a website.

## Starting Options

![Starting Options in Share Menu]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/Basic-Share-Starting-Options.jpg){: .img-responsive}
You can customize the Archilogic content that you're going to share with someone.

1. Window Mode

    * **Editor:** The editor window mode is selected as the standard option. In the editor mode the main menu is always visible. If you want to share your model with other people and want to allow them to customize it, then the editor window mode is the way to go. We suggest to only use editor window mode if you share your Archilogic model over the Google shortlink.

    * **Viewer:** The viewer window mode always hides the main menu. We suggest using the viewer window mode if you want to embed your Archilogic model as an iframe in your website. Using editor window mode in an iframe only makes sense if the iframe has a sufficient size as the bigger part of the iframe is otherwise filled with the context menu.

2. Main Menu

    * The selection of the main menu only has effect if the editor window mode is selected above. You can determine which context menu should be active or if nothing should be active.  
    You have the options to choose whether the *Interior, Architecture, Share, Help, Sign Up and Log* in menu should be active or if you choose *Hidden* the context menu should be closed.

3. Viewport Menu

    * **Hidden** Neither the Camera Bookmarks menu nor the Levels menu is active when hidden is selected from the drop down menu.

    * **Camera Bookmarks** The Camera Bookmarks menu is active by selecting this option. This only has an effect while in editor mode and not in viewer mode as the menu will not be accessible in the latter.

    * **Levels** The Levels menu is active by selecting this option. This only has an effect while in editor mode and not in viewer mode as the menu will not be accessible in the latter.

4. Presentation

    * **Play Once:** If this option is selected the presentation of the model runs through all camera bookmarks once when the link is opened or the iframe is looked at. The presentation only stops if the user interacts with the Archilogic window.

    * **Play and Loop:** The presentation keeps looping if the link to the model is opened or the iframe is looked at. The presentation only stops if the user interacts with the Archilogic window.

    * **No Presentation:** The presentation will not be started when someone clicks on the link or looks at the iframe. The presentation has to be started manually by clicking on the camera bookmarks button and then on the start presentation button.

4. Editable

    * The **Editable** checkbox only has an effect on the behavior of the user interface if you choose the viewer mode. Clicking on the full screen button in the lower right corner of the screen when in Viewer mode will switch into full screen without showing the main menu on the right side if the checkbox is unchecked. It is thus not possible to edit the model in Viewer mode. If the checkbox is checked the main menu will show up when switching from viewer mode into full screen and allow you to edit the furnishing, architectural structure or the materials.

4. Autostart

    * If the **Autostart** checkbox is active then the Archilogic 3d model loads automatically if the link is opened. This applies for Editor mode but also for Viewer mode. If the checkbox is unchecked a visitor first has to click on a play button on the screen in order for the 3d model to load. Again this applies for the Editor mode, but also for the Viewer mode or if the model is embedded somewhere as an iframe.
    Unchecking the Autostart checkbox can be a way to improve loading time of a website if there are for example several Archilogic iframes embedded on the same site.

## Google Shortlink

![Google Shortlink]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/Basic-Share-Google-Shortlink.jpg){: .img-responsive}
The Google shortlink can be used to share your model by email or chat. The link changes depending on the options you select.

## QR-Code

![QR Code]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/Basic-Share-QRCode.jpg){: .img-responsive}
Open your model on your mobile phone by taking a picture of the QR-Code. You need a thirdparty QR-Code reader app on your mobile phone for this to work. The QR-Code changes depending on the options you select.
