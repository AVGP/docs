#Sharing

Sharing your Archilogic model with a friend is very easy.  
Click on the share button to open the share context menu.

The share menu allows you to share your content in several different ways, as a Google short link, as a QR-code or even as an iframe to embed it on a website.

##Starting Options

You can customize the Archilogic content that you're going to share with someone.

1. Window Mode

    * **Editor:** The editor window mode is selected as the standard option. In the editor mode the main menu is always visible. If you want to share your model with other people and want to allow them to customize it, then the editor window mode is the way to go. We suggest to only use editor window mode if you share your Archilogic model over the Google shortlink.

    * **Viewer:** The viewer window mode always hides the main menu. We suggest using the viewer window mode if you want to embed your Archilogic model as an iframe in your website. Using editor window mode in an iframe only makes sense if the iframe has a sufficient size as the bigger part of the iframe is otherwise filled with the context menu.

2. Main Menu

    * The selection of the main menu only has effect if the editor window mode is selected above. You can determine which context menu should be active or if nothing should be active.  
    You have the options to choose whether the *Interior, Architecture, Share, Help, Sign Up and Log* in menu should be active or if you choose *Hidden* the context menu should be closed.

3. Viewport Menu

    * ***WIP Behavior in the client is confusing at the moment.***

4. Presentation

    * **Play Once:** If this option is selected the presentation of the model runs through all camera bookmarks once when the link is opened or the iframe is looked at. The presentation only stops if the user interacts with the Archilogic window.

    * **Play and Loop:** The presentation keeps looping if the link to the model is opened or the iframe is looked at. The presentation only stops if the user interacts with the Archilogic window.

    * **No Presentation:** The presentation will not be started when someone clicks on the link or looks at the iframe. The presentation has to be started manually by clicking on the camera bookmarks button and then on the start presentation button.

## Google Shortlink

![Google Shortlink]({{site.path}}/assets/images/Basic-Share-Google-Shortlink.jpg){: .img-responsive}
The Google shortlink can be used to share your model by email or chat. The link changes depending on the options you select.

## QR-Code

![QR Code]({{site.path}}/assets/images/Basic-Share-QRCode.jpg){: .img-responsive}
Open your model on your mobile phone by taking a picture of the QR-Code. You need a thirdparty QR-Code reader app on your mobile phone for this to work. The QR-Code changes depending on the options you select.
