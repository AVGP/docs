# HTML-iFrame

Embed your model in your website by using an iFrame. The HTML code changes depending on the options you've selected in the sharing menu.

We suggest using the **viewer mode** for the iFrame as it doesn't have any distracting menu elements that obscure the view of the limited iFrame size.

Bellow the iframe code you can customize the dimensions of the iframe.

The embedded iFrame looks like this:
