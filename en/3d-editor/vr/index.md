# WebVR & Archilogic: making virtual reality an enjoyable experience

## 1. What is WebVR?
WebVR is an experimental Javascript API. It allows Archilogic and other companies using it to embed a [virtual reality experience](https://about.archilogic.com/blog/case-study-interactive-serpentine-pavilion/) in a webpage without requiring the user to download a plugin. It also helps display WebGL content.

WebVR helps improve the user’s experience when interacting with content in virtual reality.

## 2. What are the benefits of WebVR for users?
Users can benefit greatly as there is no need to download any plugin to access a virtual reality experience. Oftentimes, all they need to do is click a button that is clearly labeled to start their immersive experience. That button is the VR equivalent of the “fullscreen mode” button.

WebVR also offers a solid experience on mobile, desktop computers and VR headsets. It matches the expectations users have for VR experiences.

## 3. Compatibility with VR headsets:
WebVR has evolved in the past few months to meet the needs of new VR hardware (all the new VR headsets coming on the market). Right now Archilogic supports Google Tango[Google Tango](https://docs.archilogic.com/en/3d-editor/vr/vr-google-tango.html) and [Google Cardboard](https://about.archilogic.com/blog/vr-support-google-cardboard-v2/), with Oculus Rift and HTC Vive to follow soon.

## 4. Why is Archilogic using WebVR
Archilogic is making applications in WebGL because it allows each of our 3D interactive models to provide a VR experience. Click on the VR button in a model and you are ready to experience an office, an apartment or any other type of space in virtual reality!
