# Google Cardboard
Archilogic fully supports Google Cardboard on Android and iOS mobile devices. All you have to do is open an Archilogic model in your browser and use your phone in landscape mode. Once in landscape mode a cardboard button appears on the screen. Click on the cardboard button and enjoy your model in virtual reality. We recomend using Google Cardboard 2.0 as the new button on the right side allows you to move forward inside the model.

**Important: Some In-App Browsers may not be compatible with WebVR, Please use Google Chrome, Firefox or Safari!**
