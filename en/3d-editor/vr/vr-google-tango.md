# Google Tango

Archilogic fully supports "Six degrees of freedom" for [Google Tango](https://www.google.com/atap/project-tango/).
This allows you to move around in all Archilogic models by changing your own position in the room and experience spaces with full freedom of motion.

To do so, you need:

* Google Tango device
* [This version of Google Chromium](https://drive.google.com/a/archilogic.com/folderview?id=0BzudLt22BqGRWmdoWW9yeDFkQW8&tid=0BzudLt22BqGRbW9WTHMtOWMzNjQ)

After installing Chromium, launch the application and type "chrome://flags" into the address bar to get to the advanced settings menu.

To enable WebVR, scroll through the list until you see "Enable WebVR". Tap on "Enable" and a banner will show up on the bottom of the screen saying "Relaunch now".

After restarting the Chromium, WebVR will be available and you can move around in the Archilogic models by tapping on the "VR" icon on the bottom.

Walking around and turning the Tango device will move and turn around in the model.
