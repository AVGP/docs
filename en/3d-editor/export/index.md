Once the Export menu is open you have the choice to either select a software you want to export to or a file format.
If you select a software the exporter automatically selects the best possible export options from a set of available options for this software.

The drop down menu above the download button gives you the choice whether you want to download the entire mode, the active level or only the selected object.
Please keep in mind that the export functionality only allows you to download the Architectural object and not the furniture pieces.
