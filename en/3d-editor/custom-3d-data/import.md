# Importing custom 3d data

Importing custom 3d data into Archilogic is easy. All you have to do is select the files and drag and drop them into the 3d viewport of the Archilogic window.
We suggest using Google Chrome as it is the browser that supports Archiloic the best, furthermore it's the only browser that allows you to drag and drop textures that are nested in a folder.
